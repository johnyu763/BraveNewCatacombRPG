  Text: "Brave New Catacomb Episode I\n\nAfter years of fighting for the System of
    Icarus (aka Icarus), the Crow \nsisters have served the crown, Mustaphon III,
    with absolute devotion. \nKinth\u2019s Revolt (named after the radical revolutionary
    and the father \nof the Crow sisters) has left Icarus in utter shambles and the
    national \ntreasury near empty. At the end of the conflict, Kinth was nowhere
    \nto be found, and, despite their utter devotion to the crown, both \nsisters
    were being suspected of treason. Mustaphon III admired their \ndevotion, but had
    to follow public opinion otherwise suffer another revolt. \nThus, he offered them
    each a chance. Whichever bested the other in a \nduel to the death would be allowed
    to continue serving him or have \nboth of them banished. "
